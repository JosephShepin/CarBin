# CarBin - SHS Hacks 2020 1st Place Project

Transportation makes up 29% of U.S. carbon emissions. Despite being around for over a decade, electric cars only make up around 1% of global car stock worldwide. Meanwhile, global temperatures are expected to rise by 3-4 degrees Celsius by the end of the century. So, we hoped to help increase electric car adoption by helping consumers understand the benefits of switching to electric. 

Introducing: CarBin: a tool that compares popular electric cars to your current car to inform you of the benefits and feasibility of switching to electric.

In order to make the end user's experience as convenient and intuitive as possible, CarBin supports three methods of providing your car's information: you can enter either your vehicleâ€™s VIN number, license plate number, or simply take a photo of your license plate and let our ai+computer vision system find the exact make and model.
