# CarBin

Transportation makes up 29% of U.S. carbon emissions. Despite being around for over a decade, electric cars only make up around 1% of global car stock worldwide. Meanwhile, global temperatures are expected to rise by 3-4 degrees Celsius by the end of the century. So, we hoped to help increase electric car adoption by helping consumers understand the benefits of switching to electric. 

Introducing: CarBin; a tool that compares popular electric cars to your current car to inform you of the benefits and feasibility of switching to electric.
